🎬 Movie Recommender System
This project is a Movie Recommender System built using Python and machine learning techniques. It suggests movies to users based on their preferences using content-based filtering.

📌 Features
Recommends movies based on title similarity.

Uses NLP techniques to extract and compare movie metadata.

Built using a dataset of movies with information like genres, keywords, cast, crew, and more.

Interactive and user-friendly interface (Jupyter Notebook).

🔍 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (TfidfVectorizer, cosine_similarity)

NLTK / spaCy (if used)

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:

Title

Overview

Genres

Keywords

Cast & Crew

(You can link the dataset source here if it's public, e.g., Kaggle.)

🚀 How It Works
Loads and cleans the dataset.

Combines important features into a single string.

Converts the text into vectors using TF-IDF.

Calculates similarity between movies using cosine similarity.

Returns the top N similar movies based on user input.
